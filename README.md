# Article

This is one of the first assignments from NYCDA that I had. 


For this assignment I was required to create a fake news article. I accomplished this by first taking a few minutes looking around on different news websites such as New York Times, Huffinton Post, Washington Post. I took notes on how they were laid out and identified how many columns were used for different layouts.  This assignment was based getting the basic use of HTML and CSS and getting my article to look like other articles on other websites.

I used to use a placeholder text like lorem ipsum and included a few photos of cats and dogs to illustrate what my fake article was about! I also includeded a headline, subhead, and byline.
